    find CBECC-Res draw pattern files

/home/jiml/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/CBECC_Res19/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/CBECC-Res 2019/CSE/DHWDUSF.txt

    set up new R project
    
    think I got git working for it. No version control in RStudio though
    
    trying grep 365 day DHW Profile by number of Bedrooms, after read_file it's a single char vector
    better to use stringr functions

    See CSE User's Manual, California Simulation Engine

    can use wineconsole to open a DOS window that CSE19.exe runs in
    
    copied a sample file from '/home/jiml/Documents/CBECC-Res 2019 Projects/Samples/'
    it ran, read the input file. choked cause 
        RulesetFilename   "CA Res 2019.bin"  
    encouraging
    
    created a ExampleFile that runs with CSE errors.

    try CSE some more
    make wineconsole of CSE19.exe still works
    
    $ wineconsole
    err:winedevice:ServiceMain driver L"WineBus" failed to load
    fixme:console:CONSOLE_DefaultHandler Terminating process 31 on event 0

    oops, try uninstalling  wine and playonlinux ?
    
    wineconsole still works
    
    $ apt list --installed | grep wine
        wine1.8/xenial,now 1:1.8.0-0ubuntu1~ubuntu15.10.1~ppa1 amd64 [installed,auto-removable]
        wine1.8-amd64/xenial,now 1:1.8.0-0ubuntu1~ubuntu15.10.1~ppa1 amd64 [installed,auto-removable]
        wine1.8-i386/xenial,now 1:1.8.0-0ubuntu1~ubuntu15.10.1~ppa1 i386 [installed,auto-removable]
    $ apt list --installed | grep playonlinux
    $ apt list  | grep playonlinux
        playonlinux/xenial-updates,xenial-updates 4.2.10-2ubuntu0.1 all

    so wine is still installed, but playonlinux isn't
    
    wineconsole still works
    figured out how to run CSE19 and get reports.
    still need to figure out how to put data in reports
    probably best to use this to report hourly Tinlet
    
    Go back to R to get draw info
        end use
        start time
        duration
   We can set total flow rates as we choose
   or maybe extract from DHWDUSF.txt without temperature calculations

    U0022: DHWSys 'DHW1' member tInlet has not been set yet.
    
    had to set EXPORTCOLs
    
    got Tinlet for CTZ12
    figure out how to repeat for all the CTZs
        
    made a bash script (writeRUNALL.sh) to make 
    a CSE input file (RUNALL.tst) th
    at includes all CTZs
    that called in include files (DHWDUSF.txt, coreinputfile.txt ) altered input for CTZs
    in wineconsole 
        CSE19 RUNALL.tst
        
    seemed to work

    more detailed draw patterns not in *.rep file
    see if any probes for DHW in CSE manual
    
    was able to get names of DHWDayUse, but couldn't figure out how to get DHWUse
    go back using R to read DHWDUST.txt

    DHW Profiles from DHWDUSF.txt
